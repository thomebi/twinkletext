# twinkletext

Scrolling text test for a twinkly wall. 

Requires `opencv-python` and `requests`.

## Customization

The wall dimensions are currenlty hard coded to 20x11 LEDs. This might need to be adapted in the `anim` and `write` methods.

 The text might need to be flipped after it is transposed depending on how the wall is hung up.
